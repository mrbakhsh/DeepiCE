\value{
Return three data sets in the project directory including:
 \itemize{
 \item{ppi_input_ClusterOne.txt} - threshold-based network predicted
 from MLP.
 \item{predicted_cpx_clusterOne} - predicted complexes resulted
 from partitioning the threshold-based network predicted from MLP using
 ClusterOne algorithm.
 \item{predicted_cpx_MCL} - predicted complexes resulted
 from partitioning the threshold-based network predicted from MLP using
 MCL algorithm.}
}
\description{
This function first begins by executing several
pre-processing steps to improve the quality of the raw data, followed
by concatenating the co-elution profiles of putative interacting
proteins. Concatenated profiles and class labels generated
from reference complexes are then fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
deep learning model. These models then generate a weighted protein
interaction network in which edge weights between protein nodes represent
the deep learning modelâ€™s probability estimate for interaction.
High-confidence PPIs based on the user-defined threshold is then will be
partitioned via a two-stage approach, clustering first using ClusterOne,
and then further clustering with MCL.
